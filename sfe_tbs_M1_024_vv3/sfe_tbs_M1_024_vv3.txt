#### NOTES ####

###############

# - All dimensional numbers are in units of meters.

# - User-defined functions may be used for sub-reach variability parameters only.

# - Everyline starting with '#' will be ignored. If one wants to use example inputs, s/he needs to

#   delete the '#' at the start of paramenter lines.

# - Bankfull depth can either be (A) user-defined or (B) calculated from the Critical Shields Stress and Median Sediment Size.

# - Centerline Curvature can either be (A) user-defined or (B) calculate from centerline slope.

# - Calculations of banks of channel are based on channel centerline; calculations of levels of valley are based on valley centerline.

#### GUIDELINES ####

####################

#   To ensure the program functions correctly, please abide by the following:

#   - Put each parameter or function in a seperate line.

#   - When providing an input involving pi, do so in the form of a*pi, where a is a constant. (EX: 2*pi, pi, pi/6, 3+pi)

#### DOMAIN PARAMETERS (METERS) ####

####################################

# These parameters initial the environment of the river; the follow will be an example input.

# The "Smooth" variable prevents sharp turning in centerline by averaging adjacent values.
#    Smooth=1 means taking average from 1 left point and 1 right point, so it will be 3 points in
#    total (including itself). Smooth=0 means no smooth at all. Whenever piece-wise mask function
#    is applied on centerline, at least Smooth=1 is recommended.

Datum=900
Length=  180.000
Valley Slope (Sv)=0.0011
Smooth=0
X Resolution=0.2

####################################

#### CHANNEL PARAMETERS (METERS) ####

####################################

# These parameters controls the inner channel of the river; the follow will be an example input.
# Note that if "Inner Channel Depth Minimum" is set to 0, then the depth minimum will be 
# calculated based on median sediment size and critical shields stress.

Inner Channel Lateral Offset Minimum=13.0945
Inner Channel Depth Minimum=1.0216
Median Sediment Size (D50)=0
Critical Shields Stress (t*50)=0

###############################

#### CROSS SECTIONAL SHAPE ####

###############################

# These parameters handles the cross-sectional shape of inner channel. 

Channel XS Points=21
Cross-Sectional Shape=SU
